# Number-Detection

A small practice project for pytorch. In order to find out the relations between deepth of FC layer and accuracy.

## Experiments

highest accuracy in 5 `epochs` training
|Net_1F|Net_2F|Net_3F|Net_4F|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0.9257|0.9724|$0.9743$|0.9661|

## Conclusion

> Having more fully connected layers is not necessarily better, as there are diminishing returns.
